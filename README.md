# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Project
Practicing Webscraping using Beautiful Soup to pull all the Core Pathfinder Classes into a single consolidated dataframe for 
future use in randomized character creation. Also creating an Ability Score generation program using Python. The final goal will be 
to combined both to allow for full PC creation in seconds or NPC.
